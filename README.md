# cs-comps-micropython

This repo contains the libraries we collected or wrote for MicroPython. 
For the exact sources of each library, see the comment at the top of each module.

## Software
The code should be compatible with both Micropython v1.9.4 and v1.9.3.

## Hardware
The board that we tested the devices on is Pyboard v1.1. You can order it from the MicroPython store or AdaFruit.
